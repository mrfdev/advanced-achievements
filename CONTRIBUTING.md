## Help and issues

Found a problem or need some help? The following steps may help:

1. Upgrade to the latest version of the plugin (
   available [here](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/advancedachievements.121486/history)) and a recent Paper build for
   your Minecraft version (see [here](https://docs.papermc.io/paper/getting-started).
2. Check your server's logs (including when plugins are loaded!), there may be warnings/errors/stack straces to help you
   out with your issue.
3. Do a quick search through the existing [issues](https://github.com/mrfdev/advanced-achievements/issues), you might
   get lucky!
4. Simply open a new issue and carefully fill out one of the three forms available if none of the above help or if you
   want to suggest a new feature! Help is free, so be polite and friendly! :heart:
