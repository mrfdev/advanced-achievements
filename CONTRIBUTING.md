## Help and issues

Found a problem or need some help? The following steps may help:

1. Upgrade to the latest version of the plugin (
   available [here](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/advancedachievements.121486/history)) and a recent Paper build for
   your Minecraft version (see [here](https://docs.papermc.io/paper/getting-started).
2. Check your server's logs (including when plugins are loaded!), there may be warnings/errors/stack straces to help you
   out with your issue.
3. Do a quick search through the existing [issues](https://github.com/mrfdev/advanced-achievements/issues), you might
   get lucky!
4. Simply open a new issue and carefully fill out one of the three forms available if none of the above help or if you
   want to suggest a new feature! Help is free, so be polite and friendly! :heart:

## Pull requests

1. Feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/mrfdev/advanced-achievements/issues) to get advice or discuss your

2. We use [Dagger](https://github.com/google/dagger), a popular dependency injection tool which will hopefully make your

3. If you are unsure about how to do something, simply ask by tagging @Greymagic27!
4. Historically the plugin has had poor test coverage, so don't worry too much if you can't add any tests with your pull
   request. Nevertheless if you want improve maintainability and practice your unit testing skills, please do!
5. Run `mvn formatter:format` to make sure that your code style is consistent with the rest of the project. Your pull
   request should be ready for submission! :+1:
